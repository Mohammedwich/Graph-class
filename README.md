# Graph-class
The program builds a graph from data in a file then checks if the graph is connected or not

The program takes an input file
The first line in the file contains a number that indicates the number of vertices (n).
The vertices are labeled as 1, 2, 3, . . . , n.
Each subsequent line describes the edges from each vertex (see sample files, they are called input1.txt and input2.txt)
The file input1.txt contains vertices for a connected graph
The file input2.txt contains vertices for an unconnected graph
